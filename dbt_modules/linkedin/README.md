# LinkedIn Ad Analytics ([docs](https://fivetran-dbt-linkedin.netlify.app/#!/overview))

This package models LinkedIn Ad Analytics data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/linkedin-ads). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nwR5efra1p3S1uOwUgU9Wdx7WBKXE7onxNDffK0IpgM/edit#slide=id.g311502b468_5_443).

The main focus of the package is to transform the core ad object tables into analytics-ready models, including an 'ad adapter' model that can be easily unioned in to other ad platform packages to get a single view. 

> The LinkedIn Ad Analytics dbt package is compatible with BigQuery, Redshift, and Snowflake.

## Models

This package contains transformation models, designed to work simultaneously with our [LinkedIn Ad Analytics source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin_source). A dependency on the source package is declared in this package's `packages.yml` file, so it will automatically download when you run `dbt deps`. The primary outputs of this package are described below.

| **model**                          | **description**                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| linkedin__account_ad_report        | Each record represents the daily ad performance of each account.                                                       |
| linkedin__campaign_ad_report       | Each record represents the daily ad performance of each campaign.                                                      |
| linkedin__campaign_group_ad_report | Each record represents the daily ad performance of each campaign group.                                                |

If this is not where your LinkedIn Ad Analytics data is, please add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    linkedin_schema: your_database_name
