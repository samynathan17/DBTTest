# Facebook Ads (Source)

This package models Facebook Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/facebook-ads). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/facebook-ads#schemainformation).

## Models

This package contains staging models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Facebook Ads modeling package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_facebook_ads). The staging models name columns consistently across all packages:
 * Boolean fields are prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
 * Timestamps are appended with `_timestamp`
 * ID primary keys are prefixed with the name of the table. For example, the campaign table's ID column is renamed `campaign_id`.

## Installation Instructions

Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

## Configuration

By default, this package will look for your Facebook Ads data in the `facebook_ads` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Facebook Ads data is, please add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    facebook_ads_schema: your_schema_name
    facebook_ads_database: your_database_name 
```
