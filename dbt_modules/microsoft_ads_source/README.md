# Microsoft Advertising (Source)

This package models Microsoft Advertising data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/microsoft-advertising). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/microsoft-advertising#schemainformation).

This package enriches your Fivetran data by doing the following:

* Adds descriptions to tables and columns that are synced using Fivetran
* Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
* Models staging tables, which will be used in our transform package

## Models

This package contains staging models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Microsoft Advertising modeling package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_microsoft_ads). The staging models name columns consistently across all packages:
* Boolean fields are prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
* Timestamps are appended with `_at`
* ID primary keys are prefixed with the name of the table. For example, the campaign table's ID column is renamed `campaign_id`.

## Installation Instructions
Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

## Configuration
By default, this package looks for your Microsoft Advertising data in the `bingads` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Microsoft Advertising data is, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    microsoft_ads_schema: your_schema_name
    microsoft_ads_database: your_database_name
```
