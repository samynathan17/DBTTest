# Google Ads (Source)

This package models Google Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/google-ads).

## Models

This package contains staging models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Google Ads modeling package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads). The staging models name columns consistently across all packages:
 * Boolean fields are prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
 * Timestamps are appended with `_timestamp`
 * ID primary keys are prefixed with the name of the table. For example, the campaign table's ID column is renamed `campaign_id`.

## Installation Instructions
Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

## Configuration
To use this package, you will need to pull the following custom reports through Fivetran:

* Destination Table Name: `final_url_performance`
* Report Type: `FINAL_URL_REPORT`
* Fields:
  * AccountDescriptiveName
  * AdGroupId
  * AdGroupName
  * AdGroupStatus
  * CampaignId
  * CampaignName
  * CampaignStatus
  * Clicks
  * Cost
  * Date
  * EffectiveFinalUrl
  * ExternalCustomerId
  * Impressions

* Destination Table Name: `criteria_performance`
* Report Type: `CRITERIA_PERFORMANCE_REPORT`
* Fields:
  * AccountDescriptiveName
  * AdGroupId
  * AdGroupName
  * AdGroupStatus
  * CampaignId
  * CampaignName
  * CampaignStatus
  * Clicks
  * Cost
  * Criteria
  * CriteriaDestinationUrl

The package assumes that the corresponding destination tables are named `final_url_performance`, `criteria_performance`, and `click_performance` respectively. If these tables have different names in your destination, enter the correct table names in the `google_ads__final_url_performance`, `google_ads__click_performance`, and `google_ads__criteria_performance` variables so that the package can find them:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    google_ads__final_url_performance: "{{ ref('a_model_you_wrote') }}"
    google_ads__click_performance: adwords.click_performance_report
```

By default, this package will look for your Google Ads data in the `adwords` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Google Ads data is, please add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    google_ads_schema: your_schema_name
    google_ads_database: your_database_name
```
