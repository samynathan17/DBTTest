# Google Ads 

This package models Google Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/google-ads).

The main focus of the package is to transform the core ad object tables into analytics-ready models, including an 'ad adapter' model that can be easily unioned in to other ad platform packages to get a single view. 

## Models

This package contains transformation models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Google Ads source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads_source). A dependency on the source package is declared in this package's `packages.yml` file, so it will automatically download when you run `dbt deps`. The primary outputs of this package are described below.

| **model**                       | **description**                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| google_ads__url_ad_adapter      | Each record represents the daily ad performance of each URL in each ad group, including information about the used UTM parameters. |
| google_ads__criteria_ad_adapter | Each record represents the daily ad performance of each criteria in each ad group.                                                 |
| google_ads__click_performance   | Each record represents a click, with a corresponding Google click ID (gclid).                                                      |

## Configuration

By default, this package will look for your Google Ads data in the `adwords` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Google Ads data is, please add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    google_ads_source:
        google_ads_schema: your_schema_name
        google_ads_database: your_database_name 
```

For additional configurations for the source models, visit the [Google Ads source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads_source).
